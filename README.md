## FAQ
**Should I remove custom shortcuts set in System Preferences and remap it through Keys?**
<br />
Nope. Keys should automatically catch values you set in System Preferences. Moreover after you set a custom shortcut with Keys you can always roll back to value defined in System Preferences through shortcut actions menu (â–¾).

**My issue isn't listed here. What now?**
